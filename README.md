Behavior Genetics Toolkit
==========================
The repository contains two subdirectories:

QuantGenes: Contains R code for quantifying trait heritability metrics. ***To be uploaded***

SelectiveBreeding: Contains MATLAB code that creates a 'biograph' object that can be used to graph the family tree and compute degree of relationship between relatives. Finds optimal mating pairs for minimizing colony inbreeding.
